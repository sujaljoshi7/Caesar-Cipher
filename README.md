This is a simple implementation of a Caesar Cipher game in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

## Features

- Encode a message by shifting letters forward.
- Decode a message by shifting letters backward.
- Continuous operation until the user decides to exit.
